# Supabase Restoration Checklist

## Current Status: ⏳ Restoration in Progress

Your Supabase project is being restored. All your data should be preserved!

## Once Restoration Completes:

### Step 1: Verify Database Connection ✅
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Check that the project status is "Active"
3. Note the project URL (should be: `https://jnbpiftobpbyglzrqcry.supabase.co`)

### Step 2: Check Tables Exist 📊
Run the SQL script `verify-supabase-tables.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to check:
- ✅ `uploads` table
- ✅ `students` table  
- ✅ `users` table

### Step 3: Test Upload Functionality 🚀
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/beautiful-upload
2. Download the template
3. Fill in some test data:
   ```
   Student Name,Score
   John Smith,85
   Sarah Johnson,92
   ```
4. Upload the file
5. Should see "Upload Successful!" ✅

5. **Subject selector** dropdown
6. **Better error messages**

## Troubleshooting:

If upload still fails after restoration:
1. Check Supabase project is "Active" (not paused)
2. Verify API keys are correct in `lib/supabase.ts`
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Check terminal where `npm run dev` is running for server errors
