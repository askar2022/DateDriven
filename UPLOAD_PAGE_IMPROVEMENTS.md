# Upload Page Improvements

## Summary
Updated the teacher upload page to prioritize **student names** and **separate course uploads** as requested by teachers.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Student Names Required** ✅
- **Before**: Teachers could upload using Student_ID numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Now**: Teachers MUST use actual student names (e.g., "John Smith", "Sarah Johnson")
- API now requires "Student Name" column and rejects files without student names

### 2. **Separate Subject Uploads** ✅
- **Before**: Files could contain both Math and Reading scores together
- **Now**: Teachers select ONE subject per upload (Math, Reading, Science, etc.)
- Each subject has its own grade file - no mixing of subjects

### 3. **Improved UI** ✅
- Added prominent notice box explaining requirements
- Subject selector at the top (with 6 options: Math, Reading, Science, Social Studies, Writing, Other)
- Clear validation messages
- Better template format

### 4. **Updated Template** ✅
- **New Format**:
  ```csv
  Student Name,Score
  John Smith,85
  Sarah Johnson,92
  Michael Brown,78
  ```
- **Old Format** (NO LONGER USED):
  ```csv
  Student_ID,Math Grade,Reading Grade
  1,85,92
  2,78,88
  ```

### 5. **Template Download** ✅
- Template now generates with student names
- File name includes selected subject (e.g., "Math-scores-template.csv")
- Example data shows real student names

## File Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `app/beautiful-upload/page.tsx` - Updated UI and form
2. `app/api/upload/weekly-scores/route.ts` - Updated API logic
3. `public/student-names-template.csv` - New template file

## How Teachers Use It Now

1. **Select Subject** - Choose Math, Reading, etc. from dropdown
2. **Enter Teacher Name** - Auto-filled from login
3. **Enter Assessment Name** - e.g., "Chapter 5 Quiz", "Midterm Test"
4. **Select Assessment Date** - When the test was taken
5. **Upload File** - CSV/Excel with "Student Name" and "Score" columns

## Benefits

✅ Teachers can now use actual student names (more natural)  
✅ Each subject is uploaded separately (better organization)  
✅ Clear validation messages if format is wrong  
✅ Easier to understand template  
✅ Support for multiple subjects (Math, Reading, Science, etc.)

## Backward Compatibility Note

⚠️ **Old format files with Student_ID will no longer work**  
Teachers need to use the new format with student names.
