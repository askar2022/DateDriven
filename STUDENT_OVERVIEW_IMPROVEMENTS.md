---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Student Progress Table**
Visual table showing each student's performance across ALL assessments:

```
Student          | Mid Test | Quiz 6 | Chapter 5 | Growth | Trend
John Smith       |   87%    |  92%   |    95%    |  +8    | ↗️ Improving
Sarah Johnson    |   92%    |  88%   |    89%    |  -3    | ↘️ Declining
Michael Brown    |   78%    |  80%   |    81%    |  +3    | → Stable
```

### 2. **Color-Coded Scores**
Every score is color-coded for instant recognition:
- 🟢 **Green** (85-100%): Excellent
- 🟡 **Yellow** (70-84%): Good
- 🔴 **Red** (60-69%): Needs Improvement
- ⚫ **Grey** (0-59%): Needs Help

### 3. **Growth Tracking**
Shows **point change** from first to last assessment:
- **+8** = Improved by 8 points
- **-3** = Declined by 3 points
- **0** = No change

### 4. **Trend Indicators**
Visual badges showing student trajectory:
- ↗️ **Improving** (Green): +3 points or more
- → **Stable** (Orange): Between -3 and +3
- ↘️ **Declining** (Red): -3 points or more

### 5. **Summary Cards**
Four key metrics at the top:
- 👥 **Total Students** - Class size
- ↗️ **Improving** - How many students are getting better
- → **Stable** - How many students are consistent
- ↘️ **Declining** - How many students need intervention

---

## 🔍 Smart Filtering

### Filter by Trend:
- **All Trends** - See everyone
- **📈 Improving** - Only students getting better
- **➡️ Stable** - Students maintaining performance
- **📉 Declining** - Students needing help

### Filter by Subject:
- **All Subjects** - Overall scores (average of all subjects)
- **Math** - Show only Math scores and growth
- **Reading** - Show only Reading scores and growth
- **Science** - Show only Science scores and growth
- **Overall** - Combined average across all subjects

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Data Processing:
1. **Fetch all uploads** for the teacher
2. **Group by student** ID
3. **Track each assessment** chronologically
4. **Calculate growth** (last - first assessment)
5. **Determine trend** based on growth amount

### Growth Calculation:
```
Growth = Last Assessment Score - First Assessment Score

If Growth > +3  → Improving ↗️
If Growth -3 to +3  → Stable →
If Growth < -3  → Declining ↘️
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Identify Improving Students**
Filter: "Improving" trend
- **Purpose**: Recognize and encourage success
- **Action**: Celebrate growth in class
- **Parent Conferences**: Share positive progress

### 2. **Catch Declining Students Early**

- **Action**: Schedule extra help sessions
- **Parent Conferences**: Discuss concerns and support plan

### 3. **Compare Subjects**
Select specific subject filter
- **Purpose**: See which subject students struggle with
- **Action**: Focus instruction on weak areas
- **Example**: "John improved in Math (+15) but declined in Reading (-8)"

### 4. **Track Individual Growth**
Look at specific student row
- **Purpose**: See detailed assessment history
- **Visual**: Color changes across columns show progress
- **Example**: Red → Yellow → Green = Student is improving!

### 5. **Predict Future Performance**
Analyze trend patterns
- **Improving students**: Continue current teaching approach
- **Declining students**: Change approach, add support
- **Stable students**: Consider enrichment or different challenges

## 📈 Visual Design

### Table Layout:
```
+-----------------+----------+----------+----------+---------+------------+
| Student Name    | Test 1   | Test 2   | Test 3   | Growth  | Trend      |
+-----------------+----------+----------+----------+---------+------------+
| John Smith      |  [87%]   |  [92%]   |  [95%]   |   +8    | ↗️ Improving |
|                 | (Green)  | (Green)  | (Green)  | (Green) | (Green)    |
+-----------------+----------+----------+----------+---------+------------+
```

### Color Evolution Example:
- **Student improving**: 🔴 65% → 🟡 78% → 🟢 87% ✅
- **Student declining**: 🟢 90% → 🟡 82% → 🔴 68% ⚠️
- **Student stable**: 🟡 75% → 🟡 77% → 🟡 76% ➡️
