## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth) with Google OAuth
- **Charts**: Chart.js with React Chart.js 2
- **File Processing**: SheetJS (xlsx) for Excel parsing
- **PDF Generation**: Puppeteer
- **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Google OAuth credentials

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd student-performance-analytics
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create `.env.local` file:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/student_analytics"

# Next Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma db push

# Seed sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Teachers, Staff Admins, Leaders with role-based access
- **GradeLevels**: Grade 3, 4, 5 with associated classrooms
- **Classrooms**: G3-A, G3-B, G4-A, G4-B, G5-A, G5-B
- **Students**: Anonymized analytics IDs with separate PII table
- **Assessments**: Weekly Math/Reading assessments per classroom
- **Scores**: Individual student scores with tier calculations
- **WeeklyAggregates**: Pre-computed tier counts for fast dashboard loading

### Privacy Design
- Student names stored separately in `StudentPII` table
- Analytics queries never join with PII data
- Dashboard views are completely anonymized

## Excel Upload Format

### Required Columns
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| WeekStart | Monday date | 2024-01-15 |
| ClassroomCode | Class identifier | G3-A |
| Subject | Math or Reading | Math |
| StudentName | Full name | John Smith |
| StudentID | Optional ID | STU001 |
| GradeLevel | Grade level | Grade 3 |
| Score | 0-100 score | 87.5 |

### Validation Rules
- Scores: 0-100 range
- Subjects: "Math" or "Reading" (case insensitive)
- WeekStart: Auto-adjusted to Monday
- Student Matching: By StudentID first, then exact name match
