# PDF Generation Fix Guide

## The Problem
The PDF is being downloaded correctly from your app, but when you try to open it in the browser, it's being interpreted as HTML instead of PDF.

## Quick Test

1. **Test PDF generation directly:**
   ```bash
   node test-pdf-simple.js
   ```
   This will create a test PDF file. Open it to see if it works.

2. **Test in your app:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/reports`
   - Generate a PDF report
   - Check the browser console for debug messages

## What I Fixed

1. **Proper Buffer Handling**: Ensured PDF is returned as a proper binary buffer
2. **Correct Headers**: Added proper MIME type and content headers
3. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to check PDF header

## Expected Results

- PDF should start with `%PDF` header
- Browser should recognize it as PDF, not HTML
- File should open in PDF viewer, not as HTML

## If Still Not Working

The issue might be:
1. **Browser cache** - Clear browser cache and try again
2. **File association** - Right-click the downloaded PDF and "Open with" a PDF viewer
3. **Puppeteer issue** - The fallback HTML should work if PDF fails

## Alternative Solution

If PDF still doesn't work, the app will automatically fall back to HTML format, which you can:
1. Open in browser
2. Print to PDF using browser's print function
3. Save as PDF

This ensures you always get a usable report file.
